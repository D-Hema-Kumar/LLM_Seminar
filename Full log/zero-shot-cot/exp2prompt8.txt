The man working in the attic swatted away a bee. 

The next thing that happens is that "soon the single bee was an entire [blank]." 

We can use the process of elimination to figure out what word goes in the blank. 

We know that it can't be "swarm," "pack," "countryside," or "soft drink" because those things don't make sense in the context of the sentence. 

That means that the answer must be "field of flowers."

First, the question asks for the man's conviction, so we can eliminate (B) getting hurt and (C) sweat. 

Next, the man made a "questionable comment." This could be interpreted in a number of ways, but let's think about what would make a comment "questionable" in a trial setting. A comment could be questionable if it is unclear, if it is contradictory, or if it is incriminating. 

Since the man is on trial for obstructing justice, a comment that is incriminating or contradictory would be most likely to lead to a conviction. Therefore,

So, when organic material dies, it stops being alive. It no longer breathes, it no longer has a heartbeat, and it no longer grows. 

After death, the organic material starts to decay. This is the process of breaking down into smaller and smaller pieces.

First, we can eliminate (D) and (E) because they are not related to staying focused.

Next, we can look at the context clues in the sentence. The word "but" usually signals a contrast, so we can guess that the answer might be the opposite of staying focused. This narrows our choices down to (A), (B), and (C).

This can be inferred from the fact that puzzles and riddles require critical thinking and problem solving skills. These are not activities that someone would do if they were trying to avoid pain or seeking compliments. A passing grade is also not a likely motivation, as puzzles and riddles are not typically graded activities. This leaves attention as a possible motivation, but it is not as likely as an intellectual challenge. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is most likely C, intellectual challenge.

The janitor never had much to clean after services, but there was still always a paper or two to pick up.

The first step is to identify the subject, which is "the janitor." The second step is to identify the verb, which is "never had much to clean." The third step is to identify the object, which is "after services." The fourth step is to identify the prepositional phrase, which is "but there was still always a paper or two to pick up."

Now that we have all of the information, we can start to eliminate some of the answer choices.

Next, we need to look at our answer choices and see which one makes the most sense. 

Confidence could work because if the person is confident that they won't get caught, they might not have an issue with perjury. 

Telling lies could also work because if someone is used to lying, they might not have an issue with perjury. 

 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A and B.

Q: Where are you likely to find much more than a drop of blood on the floor? Answer Choices: (A) crime scene (B) vein (C) blood bank (D) slaughter house (E) needle
A: Let's think like a detective step by step. 

A crime scene is the first possibility that comes to mind, but there could be other places with a lot of blood on the floor. A vein is not likely, because it would be inside the body. A blood bank is possible, but it is more likely that there would be drops of blood on the floor, rather than a lot. A slaughter house is also a possibility, because there is usually a lot of blood involved in slaughtering animals. A needle is also a possibility, because needles are often used to draw blood. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is most likely D, a slaughter house.

A: Let's think like a detective step by step. 

The first thing we need to do is identify the subject of the sentence, which is "Brad." Then, we need to think about what the subject is doing. In this sentence, Brad is trying to arise from bed. However, he can't do it and instead continues to do something else. 

The word "but" is a clue that something isn't going according to plan. In this sentence, Brad's plan was to arise from bed, but he couldn't do it. This means that the answer must be either (B) fall down or (C) lie down.

Now, we need to think about where one might find clothes. A few places come to mind, such as a clothing store, on the planet Earth, or in a dresser.

However, the answer choices given do not include these options. The closest option is "pants shop," but this is not a likely place to find clothes that are not pants. Therefore, we can eliminate this answer choice.

Now that we know that, we can eliminate choices (C) and (D) because they are not string instruments.

Next, we can use process of elimination to get rid of choice (E) because "troubles" is not a type of music.

The first step is to read the question and identify the key words. In this case, the key words are "jog," "likely," and "wearing."

Next, we need to think about what a person going for a jog is trying to accomplish. They are probably trying to get some exercise, so they will likely be wearing comfortable clothes.

Finally, we need to consider any other relevant information. In this case, we know that people often listen to music while they jog, so the person may be wearing an iPod.

The first step is to read the question and identify the main verb, which in this case is "get together." This tells us that we are looking for an activity that people do together. 

The next step is to look at the answer choices and see if any of them match the activity we are looking for. Answer choice (A) does not match because "see what happens" is not something that people do together. Answer choice (B) does match because people can enjoy stories together.

Next, we need to look at our answer choices. 

Option A, "have choice," doesn't make sense. If someone has a choice, that doesn't mean they would necessarily want a large house.

The potato is a root vegetable, so it is likely found in the produce section. The produce section is usually near the back of the store, so the potato is likely in the back of the store. 

The potato is usually boiled or baked, so it is likely in the section with other cooking supplies, such as the spices. The potato is likely in a paper bag, because that is what most groceries put produce in.

A: Let's think like a detective step by step. 

The first thing to consider is whether the case was dismissed with or without prejudice. If the case was dismissed with prejudice, that means the court found that there was not enough evidence to continue and the case is over. If the case was dismissed without prejudice, that means the court found that there was not enough evidence, but the case could be brought back at a later time. 

If the case was dismissed with prejudice, a likely cause could be that the court found that the evidence was not strong enough to continue. Another possibility is that the court found that there was not enough evidence to prove that the defendant was guilty

First, we need to understand what an "affair" is. An affair is typically defined as a sexual relationship between two people who are not married to each other. 

Next, we need to understand what "discovery by her husband" means. This means that the husband found out about the affair. 

Now, we can put these two pieces of information together to infer what happened when the husband discovered the affair. The most likely outcome is that the affair ended. This is because, once the husband found out, he would likely confront his wife and demand that she end the affair. If she

Next, we need to use our detective skills to try to figure out where James might have gone. Based on the clues, it's likely that James went to a private location where he could use a toilet. This could be a motel room, an apartment, or a house.

The first thing we need to do is identify the clues in the question. In this case, the clues are "courtyard" and "one thing you probably don't have to care for any longer."

Now that we have our clues, we need to think about what they could mean. "Courtyard" could refer to a type of architecture, and "one thing you probably don't have to care for any longer" could refer to something that is no longer needed or used.

A: Let's think like a detective step by step. 

First, we need to understand the question. It's asking us to identify the universe's age. 

Next, we look at the answer choices. (A) very old is a possibility, but we need more information to be sure. (B) infiniverse is not a word, so we can eliminate that choice. (C) getting younger is the opposite of what we're looking for, so we can eliminate that choice. (D) infinite is a possibility, but we need more information to be sure. (E) real is not a word, so we can eliminate that choice.

First, we can eliminate (A) and (E) because dirt and roots are not pretty. This narrows our choices down to (B), (C), and (D).

If we look at (B), we can see that there is no mention of plants. This means that (B) is not the correct answer.

First, we can eliminate (B) hatred and (C) fish market because those are not specific things that a blowfish needs to live. 

Next, we can eliminate (E) jungle because a blowfish does not need a jungle to live; it can live in other types of habitats such as coral reefs.

First, we need to understand what the question is asking. The question is asking how we might describe the snake, given the information given in the passage.

The first word is "control." This word does not make sense in the context of the sentence. If we control children, that means we are in charge and they have to listen to us. However, the sentence says that the children are not always well behaved. This means that the parents do not have complete control over them.

The question is asking why you would go fishing if you were hungry. This narrows down the answer choices to (C) catching fish, since that is the only option that would make sense if you were hungry. 

However, (C) catching fish is not the correct answer. The correct answer is actually (E) killing. 

The reason for this is that if you were hungry and going fishing, it would make more sense to go fishing in order to kill the fish and eat them, rather than just to catch them.

The first thing to note is that the person stands up and then sits right back down. This suggests that the person may have felt dizzy or lightheaded after standing up.

There are several potential causes of this feeling. One possibility is that the person has low blood pressure, which can cause dizziness when standing up. Another possibility is that the person has an inner ear problem that affects balance. Another possibility is that the person has weak muscles, which can make it difficult to maintain balance.

The adult is asking questions, so they are likely trying to figure something out. This could be done through discussion, explanation, teaching, or confusion. However, since the adult is asking questions, we can eliminate "confusion" as it wouldn't make sense for the adult to be confused. 

This leaves us with "discussion," "explanation," and "teaching." All three of these words describe a process of sharing information, so it might be difficult to choose between them. However, "discussion" and "explanation" are both more general terms, while "teaching"

A: Let's think like a detective step by step. 

The first thing to do is to look at the answer choices and see if any of them are obviously wrong. In this case, (D) sleep is probably not the correct answer, since the question is asking about what can happen when you contemplate alone for a long time, and not what can happen when you sleep for a long time.

First, we need to understand what the question is asking. It's asking what Harry said John could have always made a different of. This is a little confusing, so let's break it down. 

The first part of the question, "John felt that his actions were fate," tells us that John believes that his actions are predetermined and he can't control them.

First, we can eliminate (B) and (D) because those are not soups. (E) is also not likely to have a potato because it is a type of food storage, not a type of soup.

In order to fly in an airplane, you need to buy a ticket. This is the most important step, because without a ticket you cannot board the plane. 

Next, you need to make sure you are a passenger. This means you are not part of the crew, and you are not cargo. 

Then, you should read the safety information provided by the airline. This will help you understand what to do in case of an emergency. 

Finally, the airplane needs to have enough gas to take off. The pilot will go through a checklist to make sure everything is ready before takeoff.

Q: Where are horses judged on appearance? Answer Choices: (A) race track (B) fair (C) raised by humans (D) in a field (E) countryside
A: Let's think like a detective step by step. 

First, we need to identify what kind of event would require horses to be judged on their appearance. There are many events that involve horses, but we can eliminate some right away. For example, a race track would not be a place where horses are judged on their appearance because the focus is on their speed, not how they look. 

That leaves us with a fair, horses raised by humans, a field, or the countryside. We can eliminate "horses raised by humans" because that doesn't seem like an event. That just leaves us with a fair, a field, or the countryside. 
 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A, a fair.

First, we can look at the answer choices and try to eliminate any that are clearly wrong. (C) surface of earth is probably not the right answer, since we're looking for a place where children can play with animals, not the entire planet. (D) zoos might be a good answer, but let's see if any of the other choices work better.

(A) meadow is a good possibility - children can play with animals in a meadow. (B) play room is not likely, since we're looking for a place where children can play with real animals, not toys. (

First, we need to identify the main idea of the question. The main idea is "Why do people stop caring about their problems?"

Next, we need to look at the answer choices and see which one best supports the main idea. The answer choice that best supports the main idea is (E) become disillusioned.

Now, we need to think about why this might be the case. One reason why people might become disillusioned is that they feel like they can't solve their problems. This can lead to a feeling of hopelessness, and when people feel hopeless, they often stop caring about their problems

A: Let's think like a detective step by step. 

First, we need to identify the main clue in the question. In this case, it's the reference to World War II. 

Next, we need to think about what we know about World War II. It was a global conflict that took place between 1939 and 1945. 

Based on this information, we can eliminate choices (A) and (E) because a book or library would not be set during a specific time period like World War II. We can also eliminate choice (D) because the war took place in the past.

A spider has many eyes, so (E) two eyes is not the correct answer. 
A spider also has a tongue, but people don't have tongues, so (A) tongues is not the correct answer. 
A spider has a brain, but people have brains too, so (C) brains is not the correct answer. 
A spider has feelings, but people have feelings too, so (D) feelings is not the correct answer.

First, we need to consider what type of spiders Joe might have found. If they were small and black, they might be common house spiders. If they were larger and brown, they might be wolf spiders.

Next, we need to think about where these spiders might be found. Common house spiders are often found in dark, secluded places like closets or cupboards. Wolf spiders, on the other hand, are often found outdoors in places like gardens or garages.

Based on this information, the most likely answer is (D) mail box.

First, we need to identify the main clue in the question, which is "crabs." Based on this clue, we can make an educated guess that the answer has something to do with the ocean.

Next, we can look at the answer choices and eliminate any that are clearly wrong. For example, "bodies of water" could be a possible answer, but it is too general and could apply to many different types of animals. "Fish market" is also not a likely answer, because it is too specific and does not fit with the other answer choices.

This leaves us with three possible answers

The first sentence tells us that John was not happy with his marriage. This could be for many reasons, but we'll just go with what we're given. 

The second sentence tells us that he and his wife drifted apart. This could be because they were never really that compatible to begin with, or because they just grew apart over time. 

So, taking all of this into account, we can say that John is currently unsatisfied with his marriage and it is unfortunate that he and his wife have drifted apart.

First, we need to understand what the question is asking. It's asking what the result was of her spending money at the thrift store on knickknacks. So we need to look at the options and see which one best matches that result. 

Option A, poverty, doesn't make sense. If she's spending money at the store, that means she has money, so she can't be in poverty. 

Option B, clutter, makes a lot of sense. If she's buying a lot of knickknacks, that means she's going to have a lot of stuff,

Q: What is a place that is far away from your house and where you could consume beer? Answer Choices: (A) refrigerator (B) friend's house (C) keg (D) neighbor's house (E) kitchen
A: Let's think like a detective step by step. If the person consuming the beer is far away from their house, that means they are not at home. That narrows it down to (B), (C), (D), and (E). If they are consuming beer, that means they are not at a friend's house, which leaves us with (C), (D), and (E). A keg is a large container of beer, so it is unlikely that they are at a keg, which leaves us with (D) and (E). A neighbor's house is a place that is far away from your house, so the answer is (D).

Q: The person tried to reduce his weight with a shrink ray, but he got it backwards and only did what? Answer Choices: (A) grow (B) gain weight (C) make larger (D) augment (E) get bigger
A: Let's think like a detective step by step. 

The person tried to reduce his weight with a shrink ray. 

That means he wanted to get smaller, so the answer must be either (A) grow, (C) make larger, or (E) get bigger. 

But the clue says he got it backwards, so he must have done the opposite of what he wanted. 

That means the answer must be either (B) gain weight, (D) augment, or (E) get bigger. 

But we can eliminate (E) get bigger because it's the same as (B) gain weight. 
 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is either (B) gain weight or (D) augment.

If you are pretending to be a police officer, you are likely trying to deceive someone. This could be for a variety of reasons, such as trying to get information from them that they would not give to a regular person.
