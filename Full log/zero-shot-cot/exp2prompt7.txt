Q: Crabs live in what sort of environment? Answer Choices: (A) maritime (B) bodies of water (C) saltwater (D) galapagos (E) fish market
A: Let's think step by step using common sense and knowledge. 

First, we know that crabs are animals. 

Second, we know that animals need a place to live, or an environment. 

So, the answer must be one of the choices that provides a type of environment. 

We can eliminate (D) and (E) because they are not types of environments. 

We can also eliminate (B) because while it is true that crabs live in bodies of water, that is not their environment. Their environment would be the bottom of the ocean, or a beach, for example. 

That leaves us with (A)

Killing people is a bad thing. It is morally wrong and it is illegal. So, option (C) joy is not a correct emotion. 

Vengeance, option (A), might be a feeling someone has after killing someone. For example, if someone killed a family member, that person might feel like they need to kill the murderer to avenge their death. Going to prison, option (B), is also a possible consequence of killing someone. If someone is caught and convicted of murder, they will likely go to prison.

The word "nearly" is an adverb meaning "almost but not quite." So the word that would most logically fit in the blank would be a word with a similar meaning to "fragile." The word "durable" is a good choice because it means "able to withstand wear, pressure, or damage."

First, we need to identify what "a few people" means. This could mean two people, three people, or even four or five people. For the sake of this question, we will assume that "a few people" means three people. 

Now that we know how many people we are working with, we need to decide what kind of fun we want to have. There are many different types of fun, so we will need to be more specific. For the sake of this question, we will assume that we want to have physical fun.

A: Let's think step by step using common sense and knowledge. The first thing that comes to mind when we think of a pitcher is probably a baseball field, so (B) is probably not the answer. We can eliminate (D) and (E) for the same reason. (A) desert is not a likely answer because it's not a place where pitchers would feel stress and tension. That leaves us with (C) hell, which is a place where one might feel stress and tension. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is most likely (C) hell.

Q: What will happen to animals after eating food? Answer Choices: (A) bite (B) digestion (C) feel pleasure (D) pass water (E) listen to each other
A: Let's think step by step using common sense and knowledge. 

The first thing that will happen is that the animal will start to chew the food. This is the process of breaking down the food so that it can be swallowed and digested. 

Once the food is chewed, it will be swallowed and go down into the stomach. In the stomach, the food will be mixed with stomach acids and enzymes that will start to break down the food. 

After the food has been broken down in the stomach, it will move into the small intestine. In the small intestine, the food will be mixed with bile and more enzymes that will help to break down the

A crab is a seafood item, so the first place that comes to mind is a fish market. However, upon further reflection, one realizes that a pet shop is also a likely place to be excited about a crab. This is because a crab can be a pet. A fishmonger is someone who sells fish, so they would also be excited about a crab. The intertidal zone is the area between the high tide and low tide marks, so it is also a likely place to be excited about a crab.

John went to a party that lasted all night. Because of this, he didn't have time for what? 

The answer must be something that would have taken up all of John's time if he hadn't gone to the party. This narrows down the answer choices to (A) meeting, (E) studying, or (D) partying hard.

Q: Brad tried to arise from bed but he could not.  Instead, he just continued to do what? Answer Choices: (A) go down (B) fall down (C) lie down (D) lie to himself (E) sit down
A: Let's think step by step using common sense and knowledge. 

First, the subject is "Brad." So, we can eliminate (D) and (E) because they don't make sense with the subject. 

Next, the verb in the sentence is "arise." This is a verb that typically requires someone to be standing up. So, (A), (B), and (C) make the most sense. 

Now, we have to use common sense. It doesn't make sense that Brad would try to get up and then go back down or fall down. So, (C) is the answer. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C.

Q: WHere do people live? Answer Choices: (A) apartment (B) eat cake (C) bus depot (D) football stadium (E) surface of earth
A: Let's think step by step using common sense and knowledge. People need food, water, and shelter to live. They also need air to breathe. 

A bus depot would not be a good place for people to live because there would be no food or water, and it would be very noisy. A football stadium would also not be a good place for people to live because there would be no food or water, and it would be very noisy. The surface of the earth would not be a good place for people to live because there would be no shelter and it would be very hot or very cold.

That leaves us with the choices of apartment, eat cake, or bus depot

A: Let's think step by step using common sense and knowledge. If a person is not able to pay their bills, they must first assess the situation. They need to take a look at their expenses and see where they can cut back. They may need to get a part-time job or sell some of their belongings. Once they have a plan, they need to stick to it and make sure they are able to pay their bills on time.

A fox would not be appropriate in an English hunt, so we can eliminate (B) english hunt. That leaves us with (A) hen house, (C) mountains, and (E) England. A fox would not be appropriate in a hen house because it would kill the chickens. That leaves us with (C) mountains and (E) England. A fox would be appropriate in the mountains, but not in England.

Q: James is carrying a duffel bag with him because he doesn't have a vehicle of his own and needs a bag to carry his things in while he uses what? Answer Choices: (A) library (B) transit (C) bus station (D) army barracks (E) locker room
A: Let's think step by step using common sense and knowledge. If James is carrying a duffel bag, he most likely needs it to carry his things. He probably doesn't have a vehicle, so he can't put his things in the trunk. He also probably can't put his things under his seat or in the overhead compartment on a bus or train. That just leaves a bus station or an army barracks. A locker room wouldn't make sense because he would have a locker to put his things in. An army barracks is a place where soldiers live, so that's probably not it. That just leaves a bus station.

First, a dictionary is a book. It would not fit in a pocket. 

Second, a dictionary would not be kept on a shelf with other books in a library. It would be kept on a table or desk. 

That leaves us with the classroom or the table. A dictionary would not be kept on a table in the classroom because it would be too easy for students to grab and use it during class when the teacher is not looking. 

The answer must be the classroom.

Next, we need to hit something or someone. So (B) is not the answer.

Punching is often done with boxing gloves. However, we can also punch without boxing gloves, so (C) is not the answer.

A: Let's think step by step using common sense and knowledge. 

First, we know that Dan is a farmer, so he is likely to live in a rural area. This narrows down our choices to B, C, and E.

Next, we know that Dan only has one heifer. Heifers are young cows that have not yet had a calf. Farmers usually have more than one cow so that they can produce more milk. This means that Dan's farm is probably small. This narrows down our choices to B and E.

Finally, we know that Dan thinks it would be hard to find good farmland in a place as cold as where he lives

First, we can eliminate (B) because performing better is not a negative effect. 

Next, we can eliminate (D) because tension is not necessarily a negative effect, although it can be. 

We can also eliminate (E) because frostbite is not caused by competing in a chess game. 

That leaves us with (A) enemies and (C) sweat. 

It is possible to make enemies by competing in a chess game, but it is not the only possible outcome. Therefore, (A) is not the best answer.

A: Let's think step by step using common sense and knowledge. 

First, James thinks of criminal justice like a computer program. This suggests that he likes things to be logical, efficient, and work correctly. He would not like things that are manual, because that would suggest a lack of efficiency. He would also not like things that process information slowly, because that would again suggest inefficiency. He would not like things that power down, because that would suggest a lack of control.

The second term, "in competition," is a good term, but it doesn't make sense by itself. The third term, "practice," is a good term, but it doesn't make sense by itself.

A horse is not going to be in a western movie because that is not real life. A horse is not going to be in Central Park because there are not many horses there.

It's also not likely to be in a room where people live, like a living room, because it's not comfortable to sit on. That leaves us with the home, the dining room, and the kitchen. A sideboard is more likely to be in the dining room because that's where people eat, and it's less likely to be in the kitchen because that's where food is prepared.

A: Let's think step by step using common sense and knowledge. Closets are small spaces with not a lot of surface area for dust to accumulate. The same goes for under the bed. The television might have some dust on it, but it's not a likely place for a lot of dust to accumulate because it's not a horizontal surface. The attic is a likely place for dust to accumulate because it's a large, open space with a lot of surface area for dust to settle on.

Q: What does every person want? Answer Choices: (A) life partner (B) larger house (C) second chances (D) money (E) headache
A: Let's think step by step using common sense and knowledge. 

First, we can eliminate (B), (C), and (E) because they are not things that every person wants. This leaves us with (A), (D), and (F). 

Next, we can use the process of elimination to get rid of (F) because it is not a common desire. 

This leaves us with (A) and (D). 

Now, we can use common sense to figure out that not every person wants a life partner, so (A) cannot be the correct answer. 

This means that (D) is the correct answer 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D, money.

A: Let's think step by step using common sense and knowledge. If you are climbing up a cliff, you would need to use your hands and feet to grab onto rocks or anything else to help you pull yourself up. You would not look down because that would make you feel dizzy and you might fall. You would not throw anything because you need to hold onto whatever you can to help you climb up. Falling is not an option because that would mean you would die. So the best answer is A: Grab.

The policemen would probably not run away when they heard a cry from a distance, because that would be abandoning their duty. They might hurry along to see what was happening, because that would be part of their job. They would not be likely to fine motorists or direct traffic when they heard a cry from a distance, because those activities would not be related to the cry. So the most likely answer is (E) help.

If we were to design a place for an annoying critter to stay, the first thing we would need to do is figure out what kind of critter it is. If the critter is a fly, then we would want to design a place for it to stay that would make it easy for the fly to fly away.

(B) arena is not likely because it is not a place where people would gather unless there was an event going on. (C) ocean is not likely because it is not a place where people would gather unless they were going to the beach.

A: Let's think step by step using common sense and knowledge. 

First, we can eliminate (D) pay, because helping at the senior center is usually done for free. 

Next, we can eliminate (C) feel better, because helping at the senior center usually makes the person doing the helping feel good, not the person receiving the help. 

We can also eliminate (B) heart, because helping at the senior center usually fills a person's heart with warmth and compassion, not the senior center itself. 

That leaves us with (A) satisfaction and (E) happiness. 

It is common knowledge that helping others usually brings satisfaction.

If Sam was a stranger, then he would not be treated like a known person because, again, he would not be known. This leaves choices (A), (B), (D), and (E).

First, grapes are fruits. Therefore, the most logical place to find grapes would be at a fruit stand. 

However, if you are looking for a specific type of grape, such as a concord grape, you may need to go to a specific location, such as a vineyard or winery, where that type of grape is grown. 

You could also find grapes in a field, but this is less likely because grapes are not typically grown in fields. 

You would not find grapes in a kitchen because they are not a food that is typically prepared in a kitchen.

First, we can eliminate (A) and (C) because there are no bus stops in the ocean or at airports. 

Next, we can eliminate (B) because people don't wait at bus stops to get off the bus - they wait at bus stops to get ON the bus. 

That leaves us with (D) and (E). We can use our common sense to eliminate (E) because there are usually more buses in urban areas than in towns. 

That means the answer must be (D) - bus stops are more common in urban areas.

Mice are small animals that like to hide in dark, small spaces. They are also attracted to food. So, a place where you would not want to find mice would be somewhere that is clean and free of food. That means the loft and attic are not good places to find mice. The countryside is a good place to find mice because there are a lot of places for them to hide

A: Let's think step by step using common sense and knowledge. 

John wanted to scatter his wife's remains in a lake in the wilderness, so he must have lived relatively close to the wilderness. This eliminates choices (C) and (E).

He had to delay because he needed to take care of some business before he could go, so he probably couldn't just up and leave immediately. This eliminates choice (B).

That leaves us with choices (A) and (D). If we think about which one is more likely, it makes more sense that John would live near a state park than near mountains, so the answer is (D).

A: Let's think step by step using common sense and knowledge. 

First, the body dies. This can happen due to a number of reasons, such as old age, disease, or injury. 

Once the body dies, decomposition begins. This is the process by which the body breaks down and is eventually absorbed back into the earth. 

During decomposition, the body will experience a number of changes. These changes can be physical, such as the body becoming bloated or discolored, or they can be chemical, such as the body releasing a foul odor. 

Eventually, the body will be nothing more than bones and dust.

It wouldn't make sense to put a net in fishing gear or on a fishing boat because those are the things you use to catch fish, and you don't need a net to catch fish. That just leaves us with sports or a soccer game.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B.
pred_before :  B.
pred_after : B
pred : B

Next, let's consider the sharks. Sharks are fish that live in the ocean. They are predators that can swim very fast and have sharp teeth. They can also jump out of the water and onto land. So being in the water with sharks is not a good idea. 

Now, let's put the tornado and the sharks together. A tornado
