A: Let's solve this problem by splitting it into steps.

First, let's consider what would happen if someone kissed for an incredibly long time, say, hours on end. The person would likely experience strong feelings, excitement, and arousal. They might also experience some shortness of breath, as kissing is a physical activity that requires oxygen.

However, if someone kissed for so long that they ran out of oxygen and their body was unable to get more, they would eventually pass out and possibly die. So while it's possible to kiss for too long, it's not likely to result in anything more than strong feelings and excitement. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A, strong feelings.

First, we need to identify what information we are given in the question. We are given that there is a room with dirty gym socks, and that someone has put flowers in the room.

Next, we need to think about what we know about flowers. Flowers need sunlight and water to grow, so they would not be able to continue to grow in a room with dirty gym socks. Additionally, flowers cannot plant themselves, so option B is not correct.

Q: James noticed that his penis was bigger. .  How might he act toward his plastic surgeon? Answer Choices: (A) accidental (B) detestable (C) effusive (D) enabled (E) apathetic
A: Let's solve this problem by splitting it into steps.

Step 1: James notices that his penis is bigger.

Step 2: James acts toward his plastic surgeon.

Step 3: James' plastic surgeon reacts to James' behavior.

If we assume that James is happy with his bigger penis, then he might act effusively toward his plastic surgeon. This would be a positive reaction.

If, on the other hand, James is unhappy with his bigger penis, he might act detestably toward his plastic surgeon. This would be a negative reaction.

A: Let's solve this problem by splitting it into steps. 

Sarah gave her brother a guy. This is the subject of the sentence, so we'll start with this. 

The subject is "Sarah," so the verb must be "gave." The object of the sentence is "a guy," so the direct object pronoun would be "him." 

Now, we need to figure out what the guy is. In this sentence, it's not clear what the guy is, so we'll have to ask Sarah. 

The most likely answer is that the guy is a key, which her brother can use to open doors.

The man closed his eyes as the music played. 

The first step is to identify the subject of the sentence, which is "The man." The next step is to identify the verb, which is "closed." And finally, we need to identify the direct object, which is "his eyes." So, we have a subject, verb, and direct object. 

Now that we have that information, we can look at the answer choices to see which one makes the most sense. 

(A) coma - This choice doesn't make sense because the subject is not in a coma.  
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not (A).

(B) enjoyable - This choice could make sense because the subject closed his eyes, which could indicate that he was enjoying the music
