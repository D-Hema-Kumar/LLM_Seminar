A: Let's think about this logically. When you are kissing someone, you are physically close to them and may be exchanging saliva. This could potentially transmit a virus if the other person is carrying one, so (B) herpes is a possibility. However, (A) sexual stimulation is more likely what is going on in your head when kissing, since kissing is often a prelude to sexual activity.

A: Let's think about this logically. If the teens are trying to hide that they're drinking, then it stands to reason that whatever "gives it away" would be something that would happen if they were drinking. So, we can eliminate choices (A) and (D). Now, we're left with three choices: (B) fall down, (C) stagger, or (E) vomit. Which of these is most likely to happen if someone has been drinking?

The answer is (C) stagger.

Q: Humans need shelter to survive.  They usually find shelter where? Answer Choices: (A) underpass (B) homes (C) workplace (D) school (E) space shuttle
A: Let's think about this logically.  People need shelter to protect them from the elements, right?  

The answer choices given are all places where people spend time, but not all of them are places where people could realistically find shelter.  For example, you can't find shelter inside a space shuttle - it's not designed for that!

The most logical answer choice here is "homes."  People spend the majority of their time at home, and homes are specifically designed to provide shelter from the weather.

Q: David watched some nesting birds using his binoculars while on vacation.  Where might David be?. Answer Choices: (A) sky (B) vaccation (C) forest (D) countryside (E) roof
A: Let's think about this logically. If David is using binoculars, that means he is far away from the birds. He is probably not in a forest or the countryside because there are not many trees in those places. That leaves us with the sky, a vacation, or a roof. David is probably on vacation because he is using binoculars to watch birds. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B.

A: Let's think about this logically. A toy car is most likely to be found in a child's room, since that is where children play with their toys. However, it is possible that the toy car could be found in a boy's bedroom, since boys typically play with toy cars. It is also possible that the toy car could be found in a toy store, since that is where toy cars are sold.

A: Let's think about this logically. When you are in a reception area, you are typically waiting for someone or something. 

The most logical answer choice would be "people." This makes sense because you are usually waiting for someone in a reception area. 

The other answer choices do not make as much sense. For example, you would not be waiting for a motel in a reception area.

Q: Where might an unused chess set be stored? Answer Choices: (A) toy store (B) michigan (C) living room (D) attic (E) cupboard
A: Let's think about this logically. A chess set is a board game, so it would most likely be stored in the living room with other board games. It's possible that it could be stored in the attic if the family doesn't play chess often, but it's less likely. It's very unlikely that it would be stored in a toy store or in Michigan. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is most likely C, living room.

Q: When wildlife reproduce we often refer to what comes out as what? Answer Choices: (A) raise children (B) have children (C) photo copy (D) offspring (E) accidently got pregnant somehow
A: Let's think about this logically. 

Option A is incorrect because raising children generally refers to the process of caring for children, not the process of reproduction itself. 
Option B is incorrect for the same reason as option A. 
Option C is incorrect because photocopying generally refers to making copies of documents, not reproducing living beings. 
Option D is the correct answer because offspring refers to the product of reproduction. 
Option E is incorrect because accidentally getting pregnant somehow does not produce offspring.

A: Let's think about this logically. The artist is sitting quietly, so (A) sadness and (B) anxiety are out. He begins to paint when something strikes him, so it must be either (C) inspiration, (D) discomfort, or (E) insights. We can eliminate (C) inspiration because it's not a feeling. That leaves us with (D) discomfort or (E) insights. The artist was sitting quietly, so it's unlikely that he would be discomforted by something. That means the answer must be (E) insights.

Q: Writers with a great what can amass a large fortune? Answer Choices: (A) cookie (B) bank (C) real estate (D) imagination (E) bank roll
A: Let's think about this logically. A writer with a great imagination can amass a large fortune if they are able to write stories or books that are popular and generate a lot of income. This could come from book sales, movie rights, or other merchandise. A writer with a great cookie recipe could amass a large fortune if they are able to sell their cookies for a high price or get a lot of people to buy them. A writer with a great bank roll could amass a large fortune if they are able to invest their money wisely and make a lot of interest.

Q: If the wood texture is not smooth it is what? Answer Choices: (A) gilded (B) porous (C) solid (D) painted (E) less dense than water
A: Let's think about this logically. If the wood texture is not smooth, then it must be rough. That means it is not gilded, because that would be smooth. It is not painted, because that would also be smooth. So it must be either porous, solid, or less dense than water. We can eliminate less dense than water, because that has nothing to do with the texture of the wood. That leaves us with either porous or solid. Porous means full of tiny holes, so we can eliminate that one too. That means the answer must be solid. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is C, solid.
pred_before :  C, solid.

A: Let's think about this logically. The man is afraid of illness, so he would want to avoid places where there are sick people. This would eliminate choices (A), (B), and (E). He also would not want to visit elderly people, as they are more likely to be sick, so (C) is also incorrect. This leaves us with (D), the graveyard, as the only logical choice. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

A: Let's think about this logically. If John is traveling to a new city, he's probably not going to be checking out businesses in his hotel room or bedroom. A bowling alley also seems unlikely because it's not usually a place where food is served. That leaves us with a restaurant or a chair store. A chair store seems like an unlikely place for food to be served, so the answer must be (E) restaurant.

Q: The planet Mercury is unsuitable for human life or what? Answer Choices: (A) toxic (B) uninhabitable (C) mercury sulphide (D) poisonous (E) jupiter
A: Let's think about this logically. 

Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, so it is incredibly hot. It also has no atmosphere, so there is no way to protect yourself from the sun's rays or from space debris. Additionally, Mercury is covered in a substance called mercury sulfide, which is poisonous. So, based on these facts, we can conclude that Mercury is uninhabitable for humans.

A: Let's think about this logically.  If James is buying beer for minors, then he is breaking the law.  This is bad because he could get in trouble with the law.  He could get a fine, or even go to jail.  Additionally, he could get in trouble with the store owner, or the parents of the minors.  So, there are a lot of potential negative consequences to buying beer for minors.

A: Let's think about this logically. If someone is curious about something, they probably want to know more about it. So, they would want to either read a book or hear news about it. Seeing their favorite show or going somewhere related to it would also work. A comedy show might not be the best answer, unless it's a comedy about the thing the person is curious about.

If he begins doing housework, it's most likely because he wants a clean house, so option (E) can be eliminated. Now we are left with (A), (B), (C), and (D). It's unlikely that he's bored because he's doing housework, so (A) can be eliminated. It's also unlikely that he wants a nice home, because he already has a home. This leaves us with (C) and (D).

A: Let's think about this logically.  A baby cannot do many things that an adult can do, so that in and of itself creates difficulties for the parents.  A baby cannot take care of him or herself, cannot communicate verbally, and cannot really understand what is going on around him or her.  All of these things require constant care and attention from the parents, which can be difficult to provide if the parents have other obligations or responsibilities.

A: Let's think about this logically. If you inject water into yourself, it will most likely go into your bloodstream. Once in your bloodstream, it will thin your blood. Thinning your blood means that there will be less of it to clot, so you may bleed more easily if you cut yourself. Injecting water will also cause you to urinate more frequently.

Of the remaining choices, Phoenix and San Francisco are both cities with professional baseball teams, so either could be a correct answer. Chicago also has a professional baseball team, but the newest stadium in that city is not used by a professional team. Therefore, the answer is most likely A or D.

A: Let's think about this logically. A couple might have a lot of different things when they are deciding on stopping being married to each other, but "pleasure" and "exercise" don't make a lot of sense in this context. "Detachment" could work, but it seems a little bit of a stretch. That leaves us with "bankruptcy" and "fights." "Bankruptcy" makes the most sense here, as it is something that can put a lot of stress on a relationship.

A: Let's think about this logically. If you have too much greed, then you would be unable to keep things because you would want everything for yourself. You would also be unable to make friends because no one would want to be around someone who is constantly taking things from others. You might be able to play poker, but you would definitely be unable to conquer your opponent because they would see right through you. Lastly, you would be unable to lie because your greed would be so obvious.

A: Let's think about this logically. A potato would not be kept in a farmer's market, because that is where you would buy the potato. It would not be kept in a grocery bag, because that is where you would carry the potato home. It would not be kept in the fridge, because that is where you would store other food items. That leaves us with the pantry and the bushel basket. A potato is more likely to be stored in a pantry than a bushel basket, because a pantry is typically where dry goods are kept.

A stationery store might also be a good place to keep a letter opener because they would have other stationary items such as pens and paper. A dek would be a good place to keep a letter opener because it is a flat surface where you can put things.

However, if it's meandering, that means it's winding and not going in a straight line, so it's probably not going through the city. Therefore, the answer is probably (C) country or (D) town.

If he swatted away a bee, there's no way an entire swarm could have gotten in, so it must be something else. A pack doesn't make sense, nor does a countryside. A soft drink is an interesting choice, but it doesn't fit with the rest of the sentence. That leaves us with (E), a field of flowers.

If someone is in distress, they might be more likely to act out in violence, but again, not necessarily murder. Fear can lead to all sorts of different reactions, so it's not a clear indicator. Going to jail is a consequence of committing murder, not a cause. So that just leaves us with (E) killer. This is the only option that is directly related to murder.

You can listen to music while you knit, but you wouldn't need a radio for that - you could just use your phone or some other device. 

You could eat while you knit, but again, you wouldn't need a radio for that. 

So the answer must be that you can use a radio to listen to music while you knit. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A.

Q: Where can you go to use a piano in your neighborhood if you don't have one? Answer Choices: (A) music school (B) music store (C) neighbor's house (D) lunch (E) drawing room
A: Let's think about this logically. If you don't have a piano, you can't go to your neighbor's house to use one because they probably have one. You could go to a music store, but that seems like an odd place to use a piano. A music school would make sense, but (D) lunch is not a place where you would go to use a piano. The only other option is (E) the drawing room, which is a room in a house where people often gather to socialize.

A: Let's think about this logically. People who believe in God may go on religious pilgrimages to different locations. People who smoke marijuana may go to different locations to buy or sell the drug. People who desire to travel may go to different locations for vacation or exploration. People who use weapons may go to different locations to commit crimes. People who throw away things may go to different locations to get rid of trash.

A: Let's think about this logically.  What would people need in order to play soccer?  They would need a large open space, so they wouldn't want to be in a town.  A beach wouldn't work because there's sand everywhere and it would be hard to run.  A park could work, but it's not as big as a soccer field.  Near and outside don't make sense in this context.

A: Let's think about this logically. You can't be doing more than one thing at a time, so (C) driving is incorrect. (E) being late doesn't make sense as an activity, so it's probably not the answer either. That leaves us with (A) listen to radio, (B) solve problems, and (D) walk.

If you're walking to work, you're probably not listening to the radio (you could be, but it's less likely). So (A) listen to radio is probably not the answer. That leaves us with (B) solve problems and (D) walk.

A: Let's think about this logically. If you are getting drunk, it is unlikely that you would be having a seizure. Slurred speech is a common symptom of being drunk, so that is a likely answer. Death is not a symptom of being drunk. Forgetfulness and passing out are also common symptoms of being drunk. Therefore, the most likely answer is B) slurred speech.

Laughter is a good feeling, but it's not a reason to watch TV. You might be lazy and just want to veg out in front of the TV, but that's not really a good answer either. Erections are definitely not a good reason to watch TV! And wasting time is just that - a waste of time. So the best answer must be (C) laziness.

The other answer choices don't make as much sense in this context. If the victim was going to runaway, that would mean they would be leaving the court and would not be able to testify. If the victim was going to witness something, that would mean they would be observing something and would not be testifying.

A: Let's think about this logically.  If the carpet didn't match the drapes, that would be disappointing in any setting.  However, if this place was expensive, that narrows it down to a few places.  It's probably not a restaurant, because they wouldn't be able to change the carpeting and drapes that often.

The teacher probably wouldn't recommend going to the stationery store because that would cost money and the student probably doesn't have any. The teacher also probably wouldn't recommend going to the student's home because that would take too long. The desk drawer and cabinet are probably not good places to look for a pencil sharpener.

A: Let's think about this logically. The goal of basic training is to make soldiers physically and mentally tough so that they can handle the demands of combat. One way to do this is to push them to their limits and then have them recover and come back even stronger. This is why soldiers in basic training are often put through grueling physical challenges and then given time to rest and recover before the next challenge.

A: Let's think about this logically. If the man is having difficulty keeping track of conversations, it means that he's not paying attention to them. The only way to not pay attention to a conversation is to either ignore it or not participate in it. Therefore, the answer must be either (B) ignore or (D) answer. However, we can eliminate (D) answer because it doesn't make sense that the man would have difficulty keeping track of conversations that he's participating in.

She could put it in a paper bag and microwave it, but that seems like a lot of effort. She could go to a restaurant and order a potato, but that's not really cooking it. She could bury it underground and hope for the best, but that seems like a bit of a gamble. So the most likely answer is that she should put it in the cupboard.

So, you would use a folding chair in a situation where you might need a chair but might not have one available, or where you might need to store the chair when you're not using it. For example, you might use a folding chair at the beach, or in your garage when you're working on a project. You wouldn't use a folding chair at city hall because there are usually plenty of chairs there, and you wouldn't use a folding chair in your closet because it would take up too much space.

A: Let's think about this logically. If you're in the eastern hemisphere, you're not in the western hemisphere where John Candy and Dan Aykroyd are. The city is an urban area, so there probably wouldn't be any gazelles running around. Open plain is a good choice, but let's see if there are any other options.

It also couldn't be located in a state, because states are much too large. That leaves us with (A) valley or (E) Michigan.

A: Let's think about this logically.  If there are many frogs mating in the area, James doesn't want his son to do anything that would stop them from mating.  This means that the answer must be either (C) scare or (D) disturb.  However, we can eliminate (C) scare because that would definitely stop the frogs from mating.

If a person is looking for compliments, they might be looking for attention. If a person is looking for an intellectual challenge, then they are probably looking for a way to test their knowledge or skills.

The police station and crime scene are not likely places he would keep his gun, and the restroom is not a good place to keep a gun because it is not easily accessible.

Q: Where would there be an auditorium with only a single person speaking? Answer Choices: (A) lights (B) crowd (C) university campus (D) theater (E) park
A: Let's think about this logically. An auditorium is a large room designed to hold a large number of people, so it would make sense that there would be a large crowd in an auditorium. A university campus would also make sense, as many auditoriums are located on university campuses. However, a theater would not make sense, as theaters are designed for performances, not speeches. A park would also not make sense, as parks are not typically designed to hold large numbers of people. Therefore, the answer must be either (A) lights or (B) crowd.

Q: James's nice asked him about her grandfather. She was interested in learning about what? Answer Choices: (A) family tree (B) family reunion (C) babysitting (D) brother's house (E) heirlooms
A: Let's think about this logically. If James's niece asked him about her grandfather, she would be interested in learning about her family tree, a family reunion, babysitting, her brother's house, or heirlooms. Out of these, the only option that makes sense is family tree. 

The other options don't make sense because a family reunion would be organized by the family, not an individual person. Babysitting would be more likely to be asked about by someone who is younger, not someone who is interested in her family tree. And her brother's house would be more likely to be asked about by someone who is interested in visiting him,

Q: Who is the guard here for? Answer Choices: (A) man post (B) attack (C) intimidation (D) prisoner (E) unprotected
A: Let's think about this logically. A guard is typically posted at a location to protect something or someone. It wouldn't make sense for the guard to be there to intimidate people, because that would defeat the purpose of having a guard there in the first place. It also wouldn't make sense for the guard to be there to attack people. That would be counterproductive. So, it's most likely that the guard is posted there to protect the man, the prisoner, or something else that is unprotected.

It wouldn't make sense to put a net in fishing gear or on a fishing boat, because you would use the net to catch fish. It also wouldn't make sense to put a net in a soccer game, because you don't use a net to play soccer. That leaves us with sports or badminton.

They are powered by either electricity or some other type of energy source, and they use this energy to perform work. So, based on this information, we can eliminate choices (A) and (C).

Now, let's think about what humans can do that machines cannot. Humans are animate beings that are powered by food and water. We use our energy to perform work, but we can also use it for other things, like flying. So, based on this information, we can eliminate choice (E).

A health department is a place where you would go to get information about your health, so that's not the best answer either. A mailbox is where you would store your mail, so that's not the best answer.

This leaves us with (B), "eat cake," (D), "defend," and (E), "run fast." We can eliminate (B) because it doesn't make sense that this would be something a dog would always do for a good owner. This leaves us with (D) and (E). We can eliminate (E) because it is not a trait that is unique to dogs--many animals can run fast. This leaves us with (D), "defend."

It is also not going to be in the back yard because that is not a place where you would typically find a fox. That leaves us with the storybook and the natural habitat.

Therefore, we can eliminate choices (A) and (C). It's possible that the release of energy could feel wonderful, but it could also just feel lazy, so we can't be sure and will need to look at the other choices. An orgasm is a type of release, so (D) is a possibility. However, (E) is also a possibility, so we can't be certain which one is correct.

Riding a bike for a long time can cause fatigue because it is tiring to pedal a bike for an extended period of time. It can also cause thirst because when you are exerting yourself, you lose water through sweat and need to drink more to stay hydrated.

An English hunt is a type of horseback riding, so that doesn't make sense either. The mountains could work, but it really depends on the specific location. Having a fox outside your bedroom window would probably not be ideal because, again, it's a wild animal and you wouldn't want it coming into your house. England is a country, so that's not a good answer either.

Q: Everybody began performing once their director stated what? Answer Choices: (A) fear (B) injury (C) happiness (D) action (E) cut
A: Let's think about this logically. The director is the one in charge, so it stands to reason that they would be the ones to give the signal to start performing. If the director said something like "fear," that would probably be a cue to stop performing, not to start. The same goes for "injury" and "happiness." "Action" could be a possible answer, but it seems more likely that the director would say something like "action!" or "begin!" as their cue. Therefore, the answer is most likely (E) cut. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E).

A: Let's think about this logically. If the juror is bored and not really paying attention, do you think he would be able to take notes? This answer choice is not the most logical, so we can eliminate (A). If the juror is just nodding, then he's not really doing anything to show that he's paying attention, so we can eliminate (B). If the juror has a change of heart, then he's not bored anymore, so we can eliminate (C). This just leaves us with (D) and (E).

Q: When a person is beginning work, what are they building? Answer Choices: (A) time (B) accomplishing (C) working (D) momentum (E) tiredness
A: Let's think about this logically. When a person is beginning work, they are starting to do something. They are not yet done, so they cannot be "accomplishing." They are not "tiredness" because that is the result of work, not the beginning of it. "Working" is the present participle of the verb "work," so it cannot be the answer. That leaves "time" and "momentum." "Time" could make sense because it is something that is needed in order to work, but "momentum" is a better answer because it is something that is built up during work.

A truck stop might be large, but again, you wouldn't need a map. McDonald's is a large fast food chain, but their stores are typically pretty small. A backpack is an object, not an attraction.

A: Let's think about this logically.  Dan is a farmer, so he's going to need farmland to grow crops.  It's unlikely that he would find good farmland in a place as cold as a farm yard or a dairy farm, so those can be eliminated.  That leaves us with Arizona, Michigan, and German Field.  German Field is probably not a real place, so we can eliminate that one too.  That means the answer must be either Arizona or Michigan.

They may thank god, if they are religious, or simply be happy that things turned out well. It is unlikely that they would experience pain or hatred, or kill each other, as these are all negative emotions/actions.

A bedside table is also not going to be a place where you would find a cheap book because people usually keep their favorite books on their bedside table.

Q: If I have a pet bird, what does it likely live in? Answer Choices: (A) forest (B) bathroom (C) windowsill (D) countryside (E) cage
A: Let's think about this logically. If you have a pet bird, where would it make the most sense for it to live? It wouldn't make sense for it to live in a forest because then you wouldn't be able to take care of it. It also wouldn't make sense for it to live in a bathroom because that would be really dirty and gross. The same goes for a windowsill. The most logical answer is that your pet bird would live in a cage.

A: Let's think about this logically.  If Bob is in a closed room, then there would be no way for light to enter.  If Bob is outside in the sky, then there would be plenty of light.  If Bob is in the dark, then he would be unable to see anything.  If Bob is in his grave, then he would be dead and also unable to see anything.  The only answer that makes sense is that Bob is in a house.  Houses have walls and a door, and a small bulb would be a reasonable light source.

A: Let's think about this logically. The most likely place for a resume to end up would be in a file cabinet, where it would be organized and easily accessible. The other choices don't make as much sense - a nightstand, kitchen cabinet, and office desk would all be less likely places for a resume to be stored. The floor would be the least likely place, since it would be difficult to find and would probably get lost or damaged. Therefore, the best answer is (A) file cabinet.

Q: James saw a kite flying in the sky.  He traced the string back to its origin and found it.  Where did the string begin? Answer Choices: (A) end of line (B) hobby shop (C) his hand (D) toy store (E) child's hand
A: Let's think about this logically.  If James is tracing the string back to its origin, that means he is following the string back to where it started.  The string has to be attached to something, so it must start at either the end of the line, the hobby shop, his hand, the toy store, or the child's hand.  We can eliminate some of these choices based on the information given in the question.  For example, the string can't start at the end of the line, because that would mean the kite was flying without a string attached to it.  We also know that the string can't start at James's hand, 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is either B, the hobby shop, D, the toy store, or E, the child's hand.

A: Let's think about this logically.  If the electricity went out, it is unlikely that there would be an emergency backup generator for a bedroom or the grand canyon.  It is more likely that there would be a backup generator for a concert or opera, because people's safety would be at risk if they were unable to see.

This narrows our choices down to (D) farming areas or (E) Illinois.  Illinois is a state in the midwest, so (A) midwest is also a possibility.

A: Let's think about this logically. If you work on a car, you're trying to fix it or make it better in some way. So it wouldn't make sense if, after working on the car, it went too fast or started running. It might last several years, if you did a good job, but it's not likely to honk the horn. So the answer must be (D) go fast.

Q: When is the worst time for having food? Answer Choices: (A) digesting (B) not hungry (C) gas (D) weight gain (E) feeling of fullness
A: Let's think about this logically. The worst time to have food would be when you're not hungry, because then you're just eating for the sake of eating and not because your body needs nourishment. Additionally, if you're not hungry, you're likely to overeat and potentially gain weight. Another time when it's not ideal to have food is when you're digesting, because your body is already working hard to break down the food you've already eaten. Eating more food at this time can lead to indigestion, gas, and bloating. So the best time to eat is when you're actually hungry and your body is ready to digest more food

Q: What do parents tell a child to do on the weekend? Answer Choices: (A) study (B) begin school (C) go out to play (D) row boat (E) clean room
A: Let's think about this logically. Parents would not tell a child to study or begin school on the weekend, because those are activities that are typically done during the week. Going out to play and cleaning one's room are both activities that can be done on the weekend, so those could be possible answers. However, the most likely answer is "go out to play." This is because parents typically want their children to have fun and enjoy themselves on the weekends, rather than be stuck inside doing chores or schoolwork. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is most likely C.

A: Let's think about this logically. If someone is trying to avoid work, it means they don't want to do it. Why wouldn't someone want to do something that would lead to making money? The answer must be one of the other choices. 

The most likely answer is D) malaise. Malaise is a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or unease. If someone is feeling sick or uncomfortable, they might not want to go to work. 

It's also possible that the person is in a bad mood, which is choice E. If someone is feeling sad, angry, or frustrated, they might not want to go

A: Let's think about this logically. Jodie is worried about a tightness in her chest, so she probably doesn't want to go to a place where there are a lot of people (a concert) or a place where there are a lot of things that could trigger her anxiety (an antique shop). She might go to her bedroom to relax, or she might go to the hospital to get checked out.

A: Let's think about this logically.  If you exercise, you are burning calories and thus losing weight.  You can't get rid of the need for food because you need to eat to live.  Fitness has nothing to do with weight loss.  Sweating is a side effect of exercise, but it doesn't cause weight loss.  Fastfood is unhealthy and can cause weight gain, but it's not the only food that can do that.  Thirst is also a side effect of exercise, but it doesn't cause weight loss.  The answer must be A.

Q: Where would a corpse be covered by a blanket? Answer Choices: (A) bath store (B) bedroom (C) hospital (D) flower garden (E) michigan
A: Let's think about this logically. A corpse is a dead body, so it is not likely to be covered by a blanket in a place where people are alive and active, like a bath store, bedroom, or flower garden. A hospital is a more likely place, as they are equipped to deal with dead bodies. However, the most likely place for a corpse to be covered by a blanket is in a morgue, which is where dead bodies are taken to be prepared for burial or cremation.

A: Let's think about this logically. If there are multiple people asking for change or a ticket, it is most likely at a place where there are a lot of people coming and going. This narrows it down to either a train station, bus depot, or bridge. A beach would not be a likely place because people are not coming and going as much. A stumblebum is a person who is lazy and shiftless, so this would not be a likely place to find multiple people asking for change or a ticket. Therefore, the answer is either (A) train station, (B) bus depot, or (C) bridge.

A: Let's think about this logically. Alice is putting off going to bed, which means she wants to stay up later. She's probably not planning on doing any work or chores, so it's likely one of the other four choices. "Sleeping in" would make sense, since it's Friday night and she probably wants to relax. "Making love" could also be a possibility, although it's less likely than "sleeping in." "Rest" could work, but it's a bit of a strange choice. "Insomnia" is a possibility, but it's less likely than the other choices.

They are not likely to feel pleasure, as this would put them in danger. Procreation would also not be a priority, as this would take time and energy away from survival. Passing water is not relevant.

This leaves us with (D) hallway or (E) bedroom. If we look at the context of the question, we see that the closet needs repainting because it is too dark. This means that (D) hallway is the correct answer, as hallways are usually not well-lit. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D.

A: Let's think about this logically.  If there are no public toilets in sight, the only other places that James could go would be either a private residence or a business.  A motel room would count as a business, so we can eliminate that choice.  That leaves us with either an apartment or a house.  A bathroom would not be a likely choice, since that is usually a part of a private residence, so we can eliminate that choice as well.  That leaves us with either games or house.  Games is not a likely choice, since that is usually a public place, so we can eliminate that choice.  That leaves us with house.

The other options don't make sense because you don't need to open your eyes to see new films (you could be blind and still go to the movies), kicking a ball has nothing to do with seeing new films, and making art also has nothing to do with seeing new films.

A: Let's think about this logically. The closet is probably the easiest to dust because you can just open the door and use a duster. The television might be a little harder because you have to be careful not to damage the screen. The attic is probably the hardest to dust because it's hard to reach and there might be a lot of stuff up there.

It wouldn't come from a place like a kitchen or a refrigerator, because those are places where food is prepared or stored, not sold. It also wouldn't come from a place like a salad, because that's what you make with lettuce, not where you get it from.

If you have a courtyard, you probably don't have to care for a lawn any longer. This is because a courtyard is typically a paved area with no grass.

If they don't have anything to eat, they might open the fridge to see if there's anything there, or they might go out and buy food.

A: Let's think about this logically.  If John just bought a new water hose, the old one would most likely be in the place where he would have used it previously.  This would be either the garden shed, the garage, or the greenhouse.  The old one would not be at the hardware store because he just bought a new one, and it would not be in a van because that doesn't make sense.  Therefore, the answer must be either the garden shed, the garage, or the greenhouse.

A: Let's think about this logically.  If James was caught in his own delusions, then the truth would not help him because it would not be in line with his own thoughts.  The truth would not free his mind because he would be stuck in his own thoughts.  The truth would not further his knowledge because he would not be learning anything new.  The truth would not work to advantage because it would not be beneficial to him.  The truth would not matter to him because he would not care about it.  Therefore, the answer must be (B).

Q: What is likely to happen to someone who is learning? Answer Choices: (A) overconfidence (B) effectiveness (C) knowing more (D) head grows larger (E) growth
A: Let's think about this logically. If someone is learning, they are acquiring new information and gaining new skills. Overconfidence would be if they thought they knew more than they actually did or were more skilled than they actually were. Effectiveness refers to how well they can put what they've learned into practice. Knowing more refers to, well, knowing more information. Head grows larger is not a logical response to learning. Growth refers to physical or mental development. So the most logical answer here is D, effectiveness.

A rest area is a place where people can take a break from driving, so that's a possibility. A garden is a place where people can relax and enjoy nature, so that's another possibility.

Therefore, you would want to stay away from activities that would lead to drunkenness, like staying in bed or riding a bicycle. You might try to reach a tentative agreement with someone, or examine a thing to keep your mind occupied. However, we cannot condone suicide as a way to stay busy while drinking booze.

A desert also would not be a good place for a bird to live because there is no water and not much food. That leaves us with (A), (C), and (E). A bird might live in a cage if it is being kept as a pet, but most birds live in the countryside or on a windowsill.

The most likely places for this would be either a city or a tourist area. However, the man specifically mentions Mexican restaurants, so we can eliminate city and tourist area as potential answers. That leaves us with Mexico, Spain, and San Diego.

This means the answer must be either A, B, or C.  Now, we can eliminate B because it doesn't make sense that Joe and Jill would want their children to spend time throwing things.

Q: What could happen if someone is seeing new presents at a birthday party? Answer Choices: (A) envy (B) jealousy (C) education (D) fear (E) excitement
A: Let's think about this logically. If someone is seeing new presents at a birthday party, the most likely emotion they would feel is excitement. This is because they are seeing gifts that they may receive at the party. Envy and jealousy are both negative emotions that would occur if the person saw presents that they could not have or if they saw presents that were better than theirs. Education is not an emotion, so it cannot be the answer. Fear is not a likely emotion in this situation because there is nothing to be afraid of.

A door is something that you open and close, so there probably isn't a lot of dust in the back. A corner is a space where two walls meet, so there might be some dust in the back. A shelf is a surface where you put things, so there might be some dust in the back. A library is a place where you get books, so there might be some dust in the back.

Q: What could prevent a driving car from continuing to drive? Answer Choices: (A) automobile accidents (B) backache (C) pollution (D) smoke (E) low fuel tank
A: Let's think about this logically. 

A car needs a few things to be able to drive: gasoline, oil, and a working engine. 

If the car runs out of gasoline, it will stop. 

If the car's engine isn't working, it will also stop. 

Oil is necessary for the engine to run smoothly, so if the car is low on oil, it will eventually stop. 

Smoke might be a sign of a problem with the engine, so that could also cause the car to stop. 

So the answer could be (E) low fuel tank, (D) smoke 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) low fuel tank, (D) smoke.

A: Let's think about this logically. Boredom and hunger would not lead someone to do something that requires a lot of effort, like going to the grocery store. They would more likely lead to someone doing something that doesn't require much effort, like reading a book or playing cards. However, none of the answer choices seem to fit with the idea of boredom and hunger leading to them. The closest answer choice is "see art," but that doesn't seem to make much sense.

A henhouse is a place where chickens live, so that can't be the answer. A garden is a place where plants are grown, so that can't be the answer. A supermarket is a place where you can buy food, so that can't be the answer. That leaves us with either the plate or the bird's nest.

A: Let's think about this logically. A ferret is a small mammal that is closely related to the weasel. Ferrets are very active, and they need a lot of space to run around. They are also very curious, so they would not do well in a small space like an aquarium. Ferrets are not found in the wild in North Carolina or Great Britain, so those are also unlikely places for a ferret to be. That leaves the classroom and outdoors as the most likely places for a ferret to be.

A: Let's think about this logically. After you eat, you are going to want to put your plate somewhere where it can be cleaned. The dishwasher is the best option because it will clean the plate for you. The kitchen cupboard is not a good option because it will not clean the plate. The floor is not a good option because it is dirty. The table is not a good option because someone else might want to use the table. The flea market is not a good option because it is not a place to put plates.

A utility room might have a pail to be lowered in order to do laundry or to get water from a well. A slide would need a pail to be lowered in order to go down it. A wishing well would need a pail to be lowered in order to make a wish. A garden might have a pail to be lowered in order to water the plants. The answer must be one of these five choices.

The most likely answer is (A) bus depot. This is because people often stand in line to wait for a bus. 

It is also possible that the answer is (B) end of line. This is because people often stand in line to wait for something, such as a new product release.

A: Let's think about this logically. If we are trying to interfere with learning about science, we would want to do the opposite of what helps people learn science. 

Repeating information would help people learn science, so that can't be the answer. A sense of wonder is also a good thing when learning about science. Accidents can actually help people learn science, as they can be used as learning opportunities. Intimidation would make people less likely to want to learn science. So, the answer must be increased knowledge.

A: Let's think about this logically. The pitcher is feeling stress and tension, so it's unlikely that he would feel like he's in a desert, which is typically seen as a calm and serene place. It's also unlikely that he would feel like he's on a baseball field, because that's where he's used to being and it's not usually a stressful environment. Hell is a possibility, but it's also unlikely because it's such an extreme option. That leaves us with baseball diamond and baseball stadium. A baseball diamond is simply the field where the game is played, so it's unlikely that the pitcher would feel like that's what he's on. That

A: Let's think about this logically. If the music is festive, that means it's happy and upbeat, which doesn't really fit with the other choices. A night club is a place where people go to drink and dance, so that doesn't make sense either. A theatre is a place where people go to see a play or a musical, and an opera is a type of play or musical, so those don't work. That just leaves us with carnival and ringmaster. A carnival is a place where there are rides and games and food, and it's usually pretty festive, so that's probably our answer.

It would not make sense to put a penny in your wallet for safekeeping because then you would not have access to spend it when you need to. That leaves us with (A), (B), (E), or (F).

The answer choices given don't seem to be very good options. Becoming tired would make someone want to stop playing, not continue. Tennis elbow is a condition that can be caused by playing tennis, so that wouldn't make someone want to keep playing. Exercise is good for people, but it's not necessarily something that would make someone want to keep playing tennis specifically. Hunger wouldn't make someone want to keep playing tennis, unless they were playing to win a prize or something.

Eating fast food occasionally is not going to kill them, but a diet of fast food is not going to help them grow up healthy.

The water cooler is a common place for people to gather and chat, so it's a good guess. However, the other choices don't make as much sense. A space shuttle is not a common place for office workers to congregate, and a baby shower is not typically something that office workers would do with their colleagues.

A: Let's think about this logically. If a person has a fear of water, it is still important to make sure they are having a bath for a few reasons. One, they may have a fear of drowning, and two, they may have a fear of their skin getting wet. If we can ensure that they are having a bath, we can help to alleviate some of their fears.

A: Let's think about this logically. A cat would not snuggle up with their human at the floor, the humane society, or a comfortable chair because those are all places where humans typically sit. A cat would also not snuggle up with their human at the window sill because that is a place where cats typically sit. This leaves us with the bed as the only possible answer.

Q: There was no shade for Jenny.  She was forced to lie there exposed to what? Answer Choices: (A) full sunlight (B) bright sunshine (C) sunny place (D) eat cake (E) direct sunlight
A: Let's think about this logically.  If Jenny is lying down, she can't be in a sunny place because that would mean she's standing up.  She can't be eating cake because that's not a place.  That leaves us with full sunlight, bright sunshine, or direct sunlight.  Based on the context of the sentence, we can eliminate full sunlight because it's redundant with bright sunshine.  That means the answer must be direct sunlight. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E.

A: Let's think about this logically. If Joe is meeting a large number of people, he is probably in a large building. This narrows our choices down to (C), (D), and (E). If the building is a convention center, public building, or large building, then it would make sense that there would be many strangers who came from far away.

A: Let's think about this logically. If you jump into any of the oceans, the most likely outcome is that you will get wet. However, depending on where you jump in, you could also get tanned, as the ocean is a large body of water and the sun's rays can reach you. You could also get very deep, as the ocean is very deep in some places. Finally, you could get fish, as the ocean is home to many fish.

A: Let's think about this logically. If a person is hungry, the best option would be to go somewhere where they can get food immediately. This would be a restaurant, or perhaps a friend's house. Making bread or cooking dinner would take too long, and having lunch would not be possible if it is not already lunchtime. Therefore, the best answer is either (A) eat in restaurant or (B) friends house.

This means that they are likely in a place where they can focus and have all the resources they need to complete the assignment. An office building would be a good place for this, as would a house. An internet cafe would not be a good place for this, as it would be too noisy and there would be too many distractions.

A cabin in the woods would be too cold for a ficus. California would be too hot and dry. The front yard would be too exposed to the elements. A conservatory would be a good option, as it would provide the ficus with the warm, humid environment it needs to thrive.

Q: What is likely to be found in a book that is not a foreword? Answer Choices: (A) last word (B) conclusion (C) ikea instructions (D) afterword (E) epilogue
A: Let's think about this logically. A foreword is typically found before the start of a book, so it makes sense that the last word would be found after the foreword. The conclusion is also found after the foreword. Ikea instructions are not typically found in a book (unless it's a book about building Ikea furniture). That leaves us with afterword and epilogue. An afterword is typically written by the author and gives the reader some insight into the author's thoughts about the book. An epilogue is typically a short story that wraps up any loose ends in the book. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D, afterword.

A: Let's think about this logically.  If Sean is a wreck, then he is in a bad state.  This means he probably can't do anything that requires a lot of effort or focus.  So the answer is probably (A) stand up, (B) produce, (C) construct, or (D) make.  We can eliminate (E) build because that is what Sean loves to do.

A factory might be a place where a large container could be stored, as there might be more space and it would not be in the way of customers. A juice container would not be a likely place to store a large container, as it would likely be too small. A hostel might be a place where a large container could be stored, as there might be more space and it would not be in the way of customers.

A: Let's think about this logically. If Bob is surrounded by trees and nature, he is likely in some sort of park or forest. He can't be in a desert because that is the complete opposite of trees and nature. He can't be at a fairground because those are typically man-made with rides and games. That leaves us with (A) a rest area, (C) a state park, or (E) a soccer game. (E) is the most likely answer because a soccer game is typically played outdoors in a park.

It's unlikely that they were playing to study, in pain, or because of a knee injury. That leaves us with "have fun" and "cheers" as the most likely answers.

Q: Where can books be read? Answer Choices: (A) cabinet (B) backpack (C) table (D) shelf (E) sink
A: Let's think about this logically. A backpack is something that you wear, so you would not be able to read a book while wearing a backpack. A cabinet is a type of storage furniture, so it is not likely that you would be able to read a book while it is inside of a cabinet. A table is a piece of furniture that you might be able to read a book on, but it is not likely that a book would be stored on a table. A shelf is a type of furniture that is specifically designed for storing books, so it is likely that you would be able to find a book on a shelf. A sink is a type of plumbing fixture,

If you've been best friends with someone since kindergarten, then you would have met them in one of the places where you would have spent the most time during that period of your life - either at their house, at school, or at a shared activity outside of school. It's unlikely that you would have met at a fraternity house, since you would not have been old enough to join a fraternity, and it's also unlikely that you would have met at an internet cafe, since the internet was not as prevalent in the early 2000s as it is now.

A forest is a good option because there are trees for the squirrel to climb, and there is food available. A yard is also a good option because there may be trees or bushes for the squirrel to hide in, and there is usually food available in the form of bird seed or nuts.

(D) typhoon is also tempting because of the alliteration, but it doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. That leaves us with (A) surface of earth, (B) teardrops, and (E) motor.

A: Let's think about this logically. If you are giving assistance to the needy, it is likely because you want to help them in some way. This means that you feel some sense of pleasure or satisfaction in doing so. However, you may also feel some sense of boredom if you are doing the same thing over and over again. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is most likely E, satisfaction.

Q: What is something children can do while traveling in a car? Answer Choices: (A) listen to music (B) watch television (C) play chess (D) walk (E) play basketball
A: Let's think about this logically. 

Children can't play chess while traveling in a car because they need a board and pieces, which they can't set up while in a car. They also can't walk, because they're in a car. That leaves us with listening to music, watching television, and playing basketball. 

Of these three activities, watching television is probably the least safe, because it requires the child to take their eyes off the road. That leaves us with listening to music and playing basketball. 

Listening to music is probably the safest option, because the child can keep their eyes on the road and their hands free. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A.

Q: If you're buying beer for a float trip what are you preparing to do? Answer Choices: (A) get arrested (B) have fun (C) get sick (D) spend money (E) stupidity
A: Let's think about this logically. If you're buying beer for a float trip, you're probably planning to drink it on the trip. That means option (C) is probably not correct, since you wouldn't want to get sick. That leaves us with (A), (B), (D), and (E). 

Option (A) is possible, but seems unlikely. If you're buying beer for a float trip, it's probably because you want to drink it, not because you want to get arrested. 

Option (B) is also possible. A float trip sounds like it would be a lot of fun, and beer can certainly 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is most likely B. 

Option (D) is also possible. If you're buying beer, you're probably going to spend money.

A: Let's think about this logically.  If the dog is running towards Billy, the only place he could go to avoid the dog would be a place the dog couldn't reach.  That would be a kennel, table, porch, or backyard.  The dog could still reach him in a park.  

The answer is B, table.

A: Let's think about this logically. Where would you keep dishes? A drawer would be too small, and a shelf wouldn't make sense because you would need to take the dishes down every time you wanted to use them. A pantry might work, but it's not a common place to store dishes. An apartment is not a storage option. That leaves us with (E) cabinet.

You would not have a stove in a friend's house, because that would be rude. That leaves us with (C) living room and (E) apartment. In an apartment, you would have a stove in the kitchen.

A: Let's think about this logically. An ax handle is a tool, so it would make sense to find it in a store that sells tools. This narrows our choices down to the hardware store or the grocery store. However, an ax is a tool that is used outdoors, so it is more likely to be found in the hardware store. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).

You would need a brush, paint, and a surface to paint on.  Clothes can get stained when painting, but they are not necessary.  Wallpaper is not necessary, and neither is an electrical circuit.  The answer must be B.

A: Let's think about this logically. If you were the one investigating the crime scene, what would you do before asking a question? 

The most important thing to do would be to analyze the scene and try to piece together what happened. This would involve looking at the evidence and trying to determine a timeline of events. Once you have a good understanding of what happened, you can start asking questions.

A: Let's think about this logically. If he could hear every motion in the woods, it's probably because he was very still himself. This would make sense, because if he were moving around, he would create his own noise and not be able to hear the smaller noises around him. Therefore, the answer must be (A), (D), or (E). 

The word "still" can mean either "not moving" or "quiet." In this context, it is most likely that the author is using it to mean "not moving." This is supported by the fact that the other answer choices are all synonyms for "not moving." Therefore, the

A: Let's think about this logically. You would not "get up" after a night of heavy drinking, you would "wake up." Discomfort and headache are both logical answers, as you would likely feel both of those things after a night of heavy drinking. Shock is also a possibility, as you may be surprised at how you feel after drinking heavily the night before.

The answer is not the bed, because you're not likely to be reading something while you're trying to sleep. The fridge is also not a likely place, because most things on the fridge are not meant to be read (think about magnets, pictures, etc.). The desk is a possibility, but it's more likely that you would be reading something on a desk if it was in a binder or something else that was holding it in place. That leaves the sheet music and the medical chart. Sheet music is a possibility, but it's more likely that you would

This something could be to hasten, or to speed up the work. It could also be to bring forward, or to move the work up to an earlier date. Another possibility is to advance, or to move the work forward in time.

If someone wanted to insult somebody by calling them a fruit, the gay bar, market, grocery store, and refrigerator would all be poor choices because there are fruits present in each of those places.
