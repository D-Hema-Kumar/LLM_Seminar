A: Let's be realistic and think step by step. Where would a mezzanine be located? In a building. What type of buildings have mezzanines? Theaters, concert halls, and schools are some examples. Out of these three, which one is James most likely to work in? We can use the process of elimination to figure this out. A theater is a place where movies or plays are performed. A concert hall is a place where musical performances take place. An education institution is a place where people learn. Based on this information, we can eliminate choices (A) and (C). Now we are left with choices (B), (D), and (E

It's also common for auditoriums to be located on university campuses, so (C) is a likely answer. However, (C) could also be referring to the auditorium's lighting, so we need to consider (A) as well. (D) is less likely, but it's possible that the person speaking is part of a theater performance.

A: Let's be realistic and think step by step. 

First, we need to think about what kind of animal John saw. He saw a fox running along the beach, so we can eliminate choices (D) and (E) because there are no beaches in Oklahoma or in the mountains. 

Next, we need to think about which coast John is on. He is on the east coast, so we can eliminate choices (A) and (C) because Tennessee and Louisiana are both on the west coast.

This is because markets typically have a wider variety of fruits and vegetables to choose from, and the produce is usually fresher than what you would find at a big box retailer. Plus, you can usually find good deals on produce at a market. However, if you're looking for a specific type of fruit that is not in season, your best bet is probably the big box retailer.

The dog will not have fleas, because the owner will take care of the dog and make sure the dog is clean. The dog will not attack the owner, because the owner will have taken the time to train the dog properly.

The most logical places for papers would be (A) the synagogue, (B) the front porch, or (C) the classroom. However, we can eliminate (B) and (C) because it is highly unlikely that there would be papers on the front porch or in the classroom after services.

Q: Immediately after peeing, a person's bladder is what? Answer Choices: (A) collapsed (B) empty (C) full (D) filled (E) stretchable
A: Let's be realistic and think step by step. After you finish urinating, the first thing that happens is that your brain sends a signal to your sphincter to close. The sphincter is a ring of muscle that controls the release of urine from your body. Once the sphincter closes, the urine is no longer able to exit your body.

Next, your bladder muscles contract to push the urine towards your urethra. The urethra is a small tube that carries urine from your bladder to the outside of your body.

At this point, your bladder is full.

However, the fact that Sally is using it to read off names suggests that she is in some sort of customer service or administrative role. With that in mind, we can eliminate choices (B) and (C). (D) is not a real option, so we can eliminate that as well. That leaves us with (A) and (E).

A: Let's be realistic and think step by step. If your dad wanted to hide the check, he would not put it in a place where it would be easily found. The cash register is too obvious, and the desk drawer is a common place to look. The fish tank is a creative option, but it seems a bit too risky in case the check falls into the water and gets ruined. The bank is a good option, but it would take some time to get the check from the bank if he needed it. The pay envelope is a good option because it would be hidden and he could easily access it if he needed it.
