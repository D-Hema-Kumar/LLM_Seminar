Q: Killing people should not cause what emotion? Answer Choices: (A) vengeance (B) going to prison (C) joy (D) afraid (E) terrible
A: Let's think step by step. If someone kills another person, the natural reaction would be for the victim's friends or family to want revenge.

The reason they are on strike in the first place is most likely because they are not happy with their current working conditions, so they would need to make demands to the company in order for them to go off strike. These demands could be anything from more money to better working conditions.

A: Let's think step by step. We are looking for what Dan was actually doing, so we can eliminate (B) think and (C) reading. We are also looking for a word that makes sense with the rest of the sentence, so we can eliminate (A) eat. That leaves us with (D) meditate and (E) fall asleep.

Now that we know what the subject is doing, we need to think about what the goal or purpose of that action might be. In this case, it's possible that the goal is to gain confidence, to concentrate, or to pay attention. It's also possible that the goal is to stop talking. However, it's not possible to say

A: Let's think step by step. The clue is that they "didn't run into a gazelle." This means that they were not in a place where they would see a gazelle. 

The first place to eliminate is the open plain. This is because an open plain is exactly the kind of place where you would see a gazelle. 

The second place to eliminate is the great outdoors. This is because the great outdoors is also a place where you might see a gazelle. 

The third place to eliminate is the television program. This is because a television program is not a place.

The most likely place to buy beer would be a grocery store, since they would be able to buy other things they need. A bottle would not have enough beer for a celebration, and a casino would be too expensive. A spaceship is unlikely, and a hockey game would not have beer for sale.

We can eliminate (C) and (D) because they are not reasons why people play chess. (C) is an emotion that people might feel while playing chess, but it is not a reason to play chess. (D) is a verb, so it cannot be a reason.

Q: Where can children play with animals? Answer Choices: (A) meadow (B) play room (C) surface of earth (D) zoos (E) fairgrounds
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to identify what type of animal the question is asking for. It could be a pet, like a dog or a cat, or it could be a wild animal, like a lion or a bear. It's probably a pet, since most children don't have access to wild animals. 

That narrows our choices down to (B), the play room, or (D), the zoos. In a play room, children can play with their own pets, or with stuffed animals. At a zoo, children can see wild animals up close, but they can't usually play with them. 

 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B), the play room.

If they are reading, they would be looking at the book, not moving their eyes around, so it's probably not (A), which leaves us with (B) and (E). It's more likely that they are thinking, so (E) is the best answer.

A: Let's think step by step. If someone is afraid of water, it is still important to make sure they are having a bath. Why? 

The most logical answer would be "drowning." If someone is afraid of water, they are more likely to drown if they don't have a bath. 

"Flooding" could also be a correct answer, as someone who is afraid of water may be more likely to flood their home if they don't have a bath.

The sentence says "Christine couldn't be having a baby at her age," which suggests that she is relatively young. If she's relatively young, she might still be a girl, which would make choice (B) correct. However, the sentence also says that she is having a baby, which suggests that she is definitely an adult.

(A) ocean - This could be possible, but there's no mention of an ocean in the passage, so we can eliminate this choice.

Q: When not in use where on your property would you store you bucket? Answer Choices: (A) utility closet (B) outside (C) well (D) garden shed (E) garage
A: Let's think step by step. If the bucket is not in use, it is not being used to collect water. This means it would not be stored in the well. The garage and garden shed are both too far away from the water source, so the bucket would not be stored there either. This leaves us with the utility closet or outside. If it is raining, the bucket should be stored outside so that it does not rust. If it is not raining, the bucket can be stored in the utility closet. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B (outside) or A (utility closet).

Q: What will happen to animals after eating food? Answer Choices: (A) bite (B) digestion (C) feel pleasure (D) pass water (E) listen to each other
A: Let's think step by step. After an animal eats food, the first thing that happens is that the food enters the mouth and is chewed. Chewing breaks the food down into smaller pieces, which makes it easier to digest. Next, the food enters the stomach, where it is mixed with digestive juices and further broken down. Finally, the food enters the intestines, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream and distributed to the rest of the body.

So, to answer the question, after an animal eats food, the food is digested and absorbed into the bloodstream. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B, digestion.

We can eliminate (C) and (E) because they are not ways to convey that the juror is hearing the testimony. (D) is not a good answer because the juror is not actually writing anything down, he is just sitting there. That leaves (A) and (B) as the best answers.

This can lead to a feeling of overconfidence, because the learner now knows that there is a lot to learn and they may feel like they can't keep up. However, with time and practice, the learner becomes more effective and starts to know more. The head may grow larger as the learner's knowledge expands.

However, upon further reflection, we realize that a crab is not a fish, so a fish market is not the best answer. A pet shop is also not the best answer, because a crab is not a pet. This leaves us with two choices: a fishmonger or an intertidal zone. A fishmonger is a person who sells seafood, so they are likely to be excited about a crab. An intertidal zone is a habitat where land and sea meet, so it is also a likely place to find

Q: WHere do people live? Answer Choices: (A) apartment (B) eat cake (C) bus depot (D) football stadium (E) surface of earth
A: Let's think step by step. People need food, water, and shelter. They might also need transportation, but that's not essential for survival. 

So based on that, we can eliminate choices (B), (C), and (D). 

People could live on the surface of the earth, but they would be exposed to the elements and it would be difficult to find food and water. So choice (E) is probably not the best answer. 

That leaves us with choice (A) as the best answer.

A: Let's think step by step. We are looking for a place where James would need to carry his things with him, but doesn't have a vehicle. This narrows it down to places like the library, transit, bus station, army barracks, and locker room. We can use process of elimination to figure out the answer. The library wouldn't require a duffel bag, you can just carry your things in a backpack. The transit and bus station wouldn't require a duffel bag either, you could just carry a backpack or a purse.

So the answer choices that best reflect these motivations are "wealth" and "get rich." "Bankruptcy" could be a possibility if the business venture goes poorly, but it's not usually the goal. "Lose money" is the opposite of what people want to achieve, so it's not a good answer. "Home" might be a goal for some people, but it's not as common as the others, so it's not the best answer.

You also wouldn't look in a jungle because there is no water there for the blowfish to live in. This narrows it down to (C), (D), and (E). A fish market is a place where you can buy fish, but it's not where blowfish live. This means that the answer must be either (C) or (E).

A: Let's think step by step. If you are buying products that someone else does not want you to buy, it is likely that the person does not want you to have the product for a reason. This reason could be because the product is dangerous, harmful, or simply not beneficial for you. If the person does not want you to have the product, and you go ahead and purchase it anyway, it is likely that you will experience some sort of negative consequence as a result. This could be anything from Joy, to Disagreements, to Agony.

First, we can eliminate (A) school and (E) fairgrounds because these are not places where animals typically live. This narrows our choices down to (B) meadow, (C) lamb, and (D) farm. 

Next, we can think about what we know about sheep. Sheep are often kept as farm animals, so (D) farm is a likely answer. 

We can also eliminate (C) lamb because this is not a place. This leaves us with (B) meadow as the most

A: Let's think step by step. 

First, we need to identify what the question is asking. The question is asking for the definition of the word "fun." 

Next, we need to look at the context clues in the sentence. The context clues tell us that when Danny is having fun, he is dancing and singing with his friends. 

From this, we can infer that the definition of "fun" for Danny is something that is enjoyable, like dancing and singing with friends.

First, we need to identify what a nightclub is. A nightclub is typically a bar or club that stays open late into the night and offers music and dancing. 

Next, we need to think about where these nightclubs might be located. They are likely to be in areas where there are many people and where there is a lot of foot traffic. They are also likely to be in areas with a lot of other bars and clubs. 

Based on these criteria, we can eliminate choices (B), (C), and (D).

A: Let's think step by step. The first thing we need to do is identify the main verb in the sentence, which is "had." The subject of the sentence is "the guys," so we can say that they are the ones who had the poker game. 

We can also see that the poker game is contrasted with going to the movies, so we can infer that it was either an alternative activity or that they did both. However, based on the context, it seems more likely that going to the movies was an alternative activity.

If we want to show off the silk, the item should be something that highlights the silk's qualities, like its softness or shine. That means we can eliminate choice (A), since jeans are made of a rough fabric.

A: Let's think step by step. If you wanted to use a net, what would you need it for? 

A net is typically used for either fishing or playing sports. It wouldn't make sense to put a net in a fishing boat because you would already have fishing gear, and it also wouldn't make sense to put a net in a soccer game because that's not what nets are used for. 

So, the answer must be either (A) sports or (B) fishing gear.

It's also not likely that you would see her at your brother's house because you probably only go there for specific occasions.
