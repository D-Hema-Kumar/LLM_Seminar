A: Let's think about this logically. The child didn't know the problems his mother was going through, so all he had was care for her. He didn't know what she was going through, so he couldn't have loved her. He didn't know what she was going through, so he couldn't have become an adult. He didn't know what she was going through, so he couldn't have learned anything from her. The only answer that makes sense is A: care.

A: Let's think about this logically. The word "fragile" is antonymous with the words "durable," "undestroyable," "indestructible," and "unbreakable." This means that the answer must be one of the following: (A) indestructible, (B) durable, (C) undestroyable, or (D) unbreakable. We can eliminate (A) and (D) because they are not proper words.

A: Let's think about this logically. If you want to have fun with a few people, you're probably going to want to go somewhere where there are other people around to interact with. That rules out options A and B. Option C, the cinema, is a possibility, but it's not necessarily the most social option. You're probably going to want to go somewhere where there's more to do than just sit and watch a movie. That leaves us with options D and E. If you want to have fun with a few people, you could go to a friend's house or to the fairgrounds.

A: Let's think about this logically. The pitcher is feeling stress and tension, so it's unlikely that he would feel like he's in a desert, which is typically seen as a calm and relaxing place. A baseball field is a possibility, but it's more likely that he would feel like he's in hell, given the intense pressure he's under. A baseball diamond is also a possibility, but it's more likely that he would feel like he's in a baseball stadium, given the size and scale of the game.

A: Let's think about this logically. When you are in a reception area, you are typically waiting for someone or something. 

The most logical answer choice would be "people." This makes sense because you are usually waiting for someone in a reception area. 

The other answer choices do not make as much sense. For example, you would not be waiting for a motel in a reception area.

Q: When a person is beginning work, what are they building? Answer Choices: (A) time (B) accomplishing (C) working (D) momentum (E) tiredness
A: Let's think about this logically. When a person is beginning work, they are starting to do something. They are not yet done, so they cannot be building "time." They are not yet accomplished, so they cannot be building "accomplishing." They are not yet working, so they cannot be building "working." This leaves us with "momentum" and "tiredness." "Tiredness" does not make sense as an answer, so the correct answer must be "momentum."

Q: What is the thing that is agitated in your head when kissing? Answer Choices: (A) sexual stimulation (B) herpes (C) headache (D) catch cold (E) happiness
A: Let's think about this logically. When you are kissing someone, you are physically close to them and your bodies are touching. This can cause sexual stimulation, which may lead to an erection. Herpes is a virus that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, so it is possible to get herpes from kissing someone who has the virus. A headache could be caused by the physical activity of kissing or from stress. Catch cold is not a thing. Happiness is a feeling, not a physical object. Therefore, the answer must be (A) sexual stimulation.

A friend's house is a possibility, but it really depends on the friend and how responsible they are. A desktop is a good option because it's a hard surface and it's not likely to get knocked over. A party is a bad idea because there are a lot of people and it's easy to lose track of your belongings. An office is a good option because it's a safe place and you're unlikely to lose your phone.

Q: I want to use string to keep something from moving, how should I do it? Answer Choices: (A) tie around (B) wind around (C) weave (D) stringbed (E) ball up
A: Let's think about this logically. If you want to keep something from moving, you would want to tie it down or wind it around something so it can't budge. Weaving and stringing are both processes, so they wouldn't make sense in this context. Balling up would just make the object smaller, not keep it from moving. Therefore, the answer must be (A) tie around or (B) wind around.

Therefore, he would probably be happy to get the money back, and might treat it like it was "free money."  However, if he is not good with money, he might treat it like it was candy and spend it all quickly.  The other choices seem less likely.

A: Let's think about this logically.  If Jenny is lying down, she can't be in a sunny place because that would mean she's standing up.  She can't be eating cake because that's not a place.  That leaves us with full sunlight, bright sunshine, or direct sunlight.  Based on the context of the sentence, we can eliminate full sunlight because it's redundant with bright sunshine.  That means the answer must be direct sunlight.

The answer choices give us some options, but we can eliminate some of them right away. For example, the animal is not trying to feel pain, because that would not be an accomplishment. 

The animal is either trying to create a sand trap, live long, leave home, or eat. All of these are potential accomplishments for an animal, so we need to look at the context of the passage to see which one is the best fit.

Once it's in our stomach, digestive juices start to break it down even more so that our body can absorb the nutrients.

So, in order for animals to digest food, they need to chew it and break it down into smaller pieces. Once it's in their stomach, digestive juices will start to break it down even more so that their body can absorb the nutrients.

We can eliminate (B) because it says "no one around you" and watching television requires someone else to be around to create the show. That leaves us with (D) and (E). We can eliminate (E) because it requires someone else to be around in order for it to be fun. That leaves us with (D) as the best answer.

A: Let's think about this logically. Jodie is worried about a tightness in her chest, so she probably doesn't want to go to a concert or an antique shop. She also probably doesn't want to go to a human being, because that would be weird. That leaves us with Istanbul or the bedroom. Istanbul is a city, so it doesn't make sense that she would go there.

Envy and jealousy are both negative emotions that would occur if the person saw presents that they could not have or if they saw presents that were better than theirs. Education is not an emotion, and fear is not a likely emotion in this situation. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is E, excitement.

A: Let's think about this logically. The best answer would be a choice that would allow him to learn more about the computer. This narrows it down to A, B, or C. We can eliminate D and E because they are not related to learning more about the computer. Now, we just have to decide between A, B, or C. Classroom would be a good answer, but we don't know if she signed up for a class. Facebook could be a possibility, but it is not as likely as a classroom or school.

A cat would not snuggle up with their human at the humane society, because that would be too stressful. A cat would not snuggle up with their human in a bed, because that would be too hot. A cat would not snuggle up with their human in a comfortable chair, because that would be too low to the ground.

A: Let's think about this logically.  If John is sitting in a toilet stall, he is most likely in a bathroom.  Bathrooms are typically found in public places, such as a public building or a hotel.  A race track would not typically have a bathroom inside, and people typically do not eat food in a bathroom.

This leaves us with three choices: go down, fall down, or lie down.  We can eliminate (D) and (E) because they don't make sense in the context of the sentence.  This leaves us with (A), (B), or (C).  (A) go down could mean that Brad is trying to get out of bed by going down, but that doesn't make sense because he's already in bed.  This leaves us with

A table might be a good place to keep a dictionary, but the question says that the dictionary was in the _____. So, it can't be the answer. A shelf also might be a good place to keep a dictionary, but same logic applies. That leaves us with the classroom and the library. A classroom is a place where kids learn, and a library is a place where there are a lot of books. It makes more sense that the dictionary would be in the library, so the answer must be (D).

The answer choices are: 
A) pleasure 
B) greater mobility 
C) desire to travel 
D) global warming 
E) increased security 

Out of these answer choices, the one that makes the most sense is "greater mobility." This is because poor college students may not have the means to travel the world, but by learning about other cultures and countries, they can gain a greater understanding of the world around them.

From there, it will travel to your heart and then be pumped to the rest of your body. So, the water will definitely thin your blood. It might also dilute other fluids in your body, like your urine.

A: Let's think about this logically.  Dan is a farmer, so he's going to need farmland to grow crops.  It's unlikely that he would find good farmland in a place as cold as a farm yard or a dairy farm, so those can be eliminated.  That leaves us with Arizona, Michigan, and German Field.  German Field is probably not a real place, so we can eliminate that one too.  That means the answer must be either Arizona or Michigan.

A cabin in the woods would be too cold for a ficus. California would be too hot and dry. The front yard would be too exposed to the elements.

A: Let's think about this logically.  If Miss Grady wanted to make sure that Bob couldn't get to the stick, she would put it as far away from him as possible.  The desk drawer and kitchen drawer are both too close to him.  The classroom is also too close because he's already in the classroom.

Q: The smile gave away that the what was one of happiness? Answer Choices: (A) manual (B) rainbow (C) cry (D) frown (E) make others happy too
A: Let's think about this logically. A manual can't give away anything, a rainbow is something that might make someone happy but it's not an emotion, crying is the opposite of happiness, and making others happy too is something that might make someone happy but it's not an emotion. This leaves us with a frown, which is the opposite of a smile, and therefore the answer must be (D).

Q: The man laid on the soft moss and looked up at the trees, where was the man? Answer Choices: (A) niagra falls (B) forest (C) waterfall (D) ground (E) tree
A: Let's think about this logically. The man is laying down, so he must be on the ground. He's looking up, so he's not in a tree. He's in a forest, so it's probably safe to say he's not at Niagara Falls. That leaves us with the waterfall option.

Q: Where would you find a fox that is made up? Answer Choices: (A) storybook (B) woods (C) hen house (D) natural habitat (E) back yard
A: Let's think about this logically. If we're looking for a fox that is made up, it is not going to be in the woods or the hen house because those are real places. It is also not going to be in the back yard because that is not a place where you would typically find a fox. That leaves us with the storybook and the natural habitat. The natural habitat is not a place where you would find a fox that is made up, so the answer must be the storybook.

Q: Where do you store a large container? Answer Choices: (A) supermarket (B) factory (C) juice (D) hostel (E) cabinet
A: Let's think about this logically. A supermarket would not be a likely place to store a large container, as it would likely get in the way or be in the way of customers. A factory might be a place where a large container could be stored, as there would likely be more space and it would not be in the way of customers. A juice container would not be a likely place to store a large container, as it would likely be too small. A hostel might be a place where a large container could be stored, as there would likely be more space and it would not be in the way of customers. A cabinet might be a place where a large container

A: Let's think about this logically. If you are cleaning, you might need to use water. This eliminates choices (A), (B), and (D). Allergies could be a reason why you need to do cleaning, so choice (C) is a possibility. However, healthy living is also a reason to do cleaning, so choice (E) is a possibility as well.

A: Let's think about this logically. If someone is attempting suicide, they generally want to die. So option A, while it may be technically correct, isn't the best answer. Option B, interruption, could be a possibility, but it's not the only one. Option C, bleed, is a possibility, but again, not the only one. Option D, hatred, is a possibility, but not the only one. And finally, option E, dying, is a possibility, but not the only one.

Q: Where would you put a net if you wanted to use it? Answer Choices: (A) sports (B) fishing gear (C) soccer game (D) fishing boat (E) badminton
A: Let's think about this logically. A net is usually used for either fishing or playing sports. It couldn't be used for fishing gear, because that's what the net is. It couldn't be used for a fishing boat, because that would make it very difficult to catch fish. That leaves us with sports or a soccer game. A net is most commonly used in soccer, so the answer must be (C).

Q: What are people likely to do when an unexpected decent outcome occurs? Answer Choices: (A) kill each other (B) thank god (C) experience pain (D) hatred (E) talk to each other
A: Let's think about this logically. If an unexpected decent outcome occurs, people are likely to be pleased with the result. They may thank god, if they are religious, or simply be happy that things turned out well. It is unlikely that they would experience pain or hatred, or kill each other, as these are all negative emotions/actions. Talking to each other is a neutral option, so it is possible that people would do this as well.

Q: Where would you run in to a niece you only see every one and a while? Answer Choices: (A) family reunion (B) brother's house (C) family picture book (D) family tree (E) party
A: Let's think about this logically. If you only see your niece every once in a while, it's probably not going to be at a family reunion, because those are usually annual events. It's also not likely that you'd run into her at your brother's house, because you probably only go there on special occasions. The family picture book and family tree are both unlikely as well, because you would have to be looking for her specifically in those places. That leaves us with (E), a party. It's possible that you only see your niece at parties, or that you only see her at parties and other special occasions. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is most likely E.

A: Let's think about this logically. If the person is worried about forgetting their chewables, it's probably because they're worried about something related to their health. Chewables are often used to help with indigestion, so the person is probably worried about getting heartburn or indigestion from eating the hamburger. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) heartburn.

The other choices can be eliminated because they do not make sense in the context of the question. (B) sleep and (C) sleeping are not activities, and (D) in motion is not an energy source. This means the answer must be (A) action.

A: Let's think about this logically.  If the electricity went out, it is unlikely that there would be an emergency backup generator for a bedroom or the grand canyon.  It is more likely that there would be a backup generator for a concert or opera, because people's safety would be at risk if they were unable to see.

A: Let's think about this logically.  A baby cannot arrive early, because that would mean the baby was born before it was conceived.  A baby cannot learn to walk, because that would mean the baby could walk before it was born.  A baby cannot be a boy or girl, because that would mean the baby was born with a gender.  A baby cannot bring joy, because that would mean the baby was born with emotions.  A baby cannot talk nonsense, because that would mean the baby was born with the ability to speak.
