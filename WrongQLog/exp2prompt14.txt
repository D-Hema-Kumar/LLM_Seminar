Q: What happens to a body after death? Answer Choices: (A) rebirth (B) human experience (C) sadness (D) decomposition (E) obesity
A: Let's be realistic and think step by step. 

The first thing that happens to a body after death is that it starts to decompose.

 decomposition is followed by a process called human experience. This is when the soul of the deceased leaves the body and enters into the afterlife. What happens after that is up to the individual's beliefs and religion.
