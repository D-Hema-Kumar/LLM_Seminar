Q: Crabs live in what sort of environment? Answer Choices: (A) maritime (B) bodies of water (C) saltwater (D) galapagos (E) fish market
A: Let's solve this problem by splitting it into steps. 

First, we'll look up what a crab is. 

According to National Geographic, crabs are "marine crustaceans." 

This means that they are animals that have a hard shell and live in water. 

Now that we know what a crab is, we can look at the answer choices and see which one is the best fit. 

The answer choices are: (A) maritime (B) bodies of water (C) saltwater (D) Galapagos (E) fish market. 

Since we know that crabs live in water, we can eliminate choices 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B, bodies of water.

Q: The chef wanted to perfect his craft, what did he do? Answer Choices: (A) thin potatos (B) prepare food (C) study french cooking (D) drink (E) cook dinner
A: Let's solve this problem by splitting it into steps. 

The first step is to identify the main verb in the sentence, which is "wanted." The subject of the sentence is "chef," and the direct object is "craft." 

Next, we need to identify the purpose of the chef's action. In this sentence, the purpose is to "perfect" his craft. 

Now that we know the subject, verb, and purpose of the sentence, we can look at the answer choices to see which one best fits. 

(A) thin potatos - This is not a relevant action for perfecting one's craft. 
 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not A. 

(B) prepare food - This is a relevant action for perfecting one's craft. 

Therefore, among A through

Q: John had a massive debt to 50 million dollars.  Compared to that, Leo's 2000 dollar debt seemed what? Answer Choices: (A) dwarf (B) inconsequential (C) insubstantial (D) lame (E) tiny
A: Let's solve this problem by splitting it into steps. 

First, we need to find out what 50 million dollars is compared to 2000 dollars. We can do this by finding how many times 2000 dollars goes into 50 million dollars. 

50 million dollars is 25,000 times greater than 2000 dollars. 

Next, we need to decide which word from the answer choices best describes the relationship between 50 million dollars and 2000 dollars. 

The word "dwarf" means "to be much smaller than something else." The word "insubstantial" means "not large or important enough to be worth considering." The word "tiny" means "very small

Step 1:
First, let's look at the definition of "deceptive." Deceptive means "intending to deceive or mislead." 

Step 2:
Now, let's look at the definition of "lie." A lie is "an intentionally false statement." 

Step 3:
Now that we have the definitions of both "deceptive" and "lie," we can see that Sam was not lying. He may have left out important details, but he did not make an intentionally false statement. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is D: deceptive.

Q: What happens if someone kisses too long? Answer Choices: (A) strong feelings (B) herpes (C) shortness of breath (D) excitement (E) arousal
A: Let's solve this problem by splitting it into steps.

First, let's consider what would happen if someone kissed for an incredibly long time, say, hours on end. The person would likely experience strong feelings, excitement, and arousal. They might also experience some shortness of breath, as kissing is a physical activity that requires oxygen.

However, if someone kissed for so long that they ran out of oxygen and their body was unable to get more, they would eventually pass out and possibly die. So while it's possible to kiss for too long, it's not likely to result in anything more than strong feelings and excitement. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is A, strong feelings.
